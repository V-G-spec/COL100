Problem 5

A1
a.

For x-->0, we will have a problem of loss of significant digits because a+x --> x
Therefore, we can use the binomial expansion to prove that this is equivalent to x times a function which only contains additive terms

b.
For x>>a, we will have a problem of loss of significant digits because sqrt(x^2 - a) --> x
So, let the first term be I1 and 2nd be I2 s.t. expression is I1-I2
We can multiply divide the expression with I1+I2
New expression -> a/(I1+I2)

A3.
1.1102230246251565e-16


A2. 
For a monotonically increasing function, we will add in decreasing order because in later terms, the significant digits would be in decimals if error is less
And you need so Sum it (integrate basically) , from maan le x= 3 to 5
Will you start adding values from 5 or from 3
Answer is 5 kyuki waha pe value heighest hai
And going from x=5 to 5 mai jo sum hoga
It will be closer to actual value than jo x=3 se 4 ka dum hoga
Hence increasing function ke liye decreasing order Mai sum karna hai
